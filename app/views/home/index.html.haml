%h3 Welcome to GeoChat!

To help you get started we suggest you do the following:

%ul
  %li #{link_to 'Create a group', new_group_path} or #{link_to 'join one'}: a group is a bunch of people ready to discuss and collaborate on a topic.
  %li #{link_to 'Configure a channel', channels_path} so that you can send and receive messages from your groups in your phone, email, twitter or instant messenger
  %li #{link_to 'Tell us your location'} so that people know you are near them when they need help or can find when you are in help

%h4 Latest messages from your groups

List...

%h4 Groups near you

Will list groups near to the user's location... when he signs up through the web we will guess his location with his IP.
